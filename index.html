    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>I'm still narrowing my interests. I like data-driven artificial intelligence that thinks the way we do.
        I am also very interested in knowledge representation.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    
    <p>Some recent and current work I've done:</p>
    
    <p><b>CARVE Resurrection</b>
    </br>CARVE is a model of turning quantitative data
    into qualitative representations. The model takes in
    cases and distributional data to assign each case a
    qualitative predicate for any kind of quantitative dimension.
    The resulting representation lends itself to a different
    kind of AI reasoning that can be done than purely
    quantitative data. For example, using the proprietary
    reasoning methods from the QRG, if a country is LARGE,
    it may be more likely to export raw materials. If a
    country has HIGH GDP, it may also have a high 
    Human Development Index.

    The model was developed in the early 2000s by <a href="https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~paritosh/">Praveen Paritosh</a>
    , a Northwestern QRG PhD graduate. It was never
    seriously tested on large datasets that have become
    more readily available since the model's creation.
    This is the gap my work is trying to fill.

    <p><b>NASA Student Airborne Research Program</b>
    </br>The <a href="https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/content/Student_Airborne_Research_Program">SARP</a>
    is an undergraduate research program dedicated to environmental research through airborne science.
    Undergraduates from all over the country travel to the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, CA, where they take part in reserach flights aboard a flying
    NASA laboratory. Using the data collected from their flights, students complete their own research project over the course of the summer in one of four main fields:
    Aerosols, Whole Air Sampling, and Remote Optical Sensing (land & sea).

    My research studied the effect of Solar Panels on Land Surface Temperature (LST). Using hyperspectral imagery, I mapped the location of solar panels in the Santa Barbara
    area. After polynomial point correction, georeferencing, dataset cleaning, and plenty of validation, I paired this data with a map of Land Surface Temperature
    from a similar timeframe. I found preliminary evidence of solar panels being cooler than their surrounding areas. The reasoning behind this is thought to be that
    since solar panels actively convert some of their absorbed solar energy to electric output, they release proportionately less energy as heat. This has impacts on 
    Earth's radiation budget. You can see my talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lURJYgumkLo">here</a>.
