    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>I'm still narrowing my interests. I like data-driven artificial intelligence that thinks the way we do.
        I am also very interested in knowledge representation.

    <p>Some recent and current work I've done:</p>
    
    <p><b>CARVE Resurrection</b>
    </br>CARVE is a model of turning quantitative data
    into qualitative representations. The model takes in
    cases and distributional data to assign each case a
    qualitative predicate for any kind of quantitative dimension.
    The resulting representation lends itself to a different
    kind of AI reasoning that can be done than purely
    quantitative data. For example, using the proprietary
    reasoning methods from the QRG, if a country is LARGE,
    it may be more likely to export raw materials. If a
    country has HIGH GDP, it may also have a high 
    Human Development Index.

    The model was developed in the early 2000s by Praveen
    Paritosh, a Northwestern QRG PhD graduate. It was never
    seriously tested on large datasets that have become
    more readily available since the model's creation.
    This is the gap my work is trying to fill.
