    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>I'm still narrowing my interests. I like data-driven artificial intelligence that thinks the way we do.
        I am also very interested in knowledge representation.
    </li>
    
    
    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    
    <p>My normal teaching schedule looks like this:</p>
    
    <p><b>Fall</b>: <a href="cogsci_207.htm">Cognitive Science 207</a>:
    <b>Introduction to Cognitive Modeling.</b>
    </br>This is part of the introductory sequence in Cognitive Science,
    and a science distribution course in WCAS. It does not require
    programming at all. Instead, you'll be using some off-the-shelf AI
    systems as a way to get experience with cognitive
    modeling. Ultimately, I think it useful for every cognitive scientist
    to have some programming experience, but not for the reason you might
    think.  It's not about writing code per se, but about understanding
    how to think procedurally. One of the insights that the field of
    Cognitive Science is founded on is the idea that minds are a kind of
    computation. So computation is actually one of the languages for
    expressing theories, not just a means of simulation. It's hard to get
    certain intuitions about computation without programming, but that can
    come later, if you decide that you're deeply interested in the
    field.</p>
    
    <p><b>Winter:</b> I alternate between two advanced AI courses:</p>
    
    <ul>
     <li><a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/344.html"><b>EECS 344:</a>
      Design of Computer Problem Solvers</b></li>
     <li><a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/371.html">
     EECS 371:</a>
      <b>Knowledge Representation</b>
         </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you are interested in Artificial Intelligence, you really should
    take both of these courses. There is a lot of programming in 344, in
    Common Lisp, so taking EECS 325 before is a good idea. 371 uses Common
    Lisp as well.</p>
    
    <p><b>Spring:</b> 
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/396-496-16.html"><b>Conversational Interfaces</b></a>  This course concerns AI systems that interact with people via natural modallities, including natural language, speech, vision, and sketching.  It involves considerable amount of reading of the literature in both cognitive science, about the nature of human conversation, and in artificial intelligence, on how to build dialogue systems.  It includes substantial project work, including hands-on experience in building knowledge-rich systems that can participate in conversations.  For example, the prototype of this course, which ran in Spring Quarter 2018, led to the development of the Kiosk that was installed in September 2018 in Seely Mudd to provide visitors and residents with information about the Computer Science department.  
    </li>
    <li>A seminar course of some sort.  For Spring 2010, it was <a href="./395hlai/index.htm">Human-level AI<a></li>
    For Spring 2014, it was Qualitative Representation.  For Spring 2016, it was a Companions Cognitive Systems Studio course.
    </ul>
    <p>Please check the department web site to see which course(s) are being offered for any specific quarter</p>
    
    <p><b> Teaching this year (2019-2020):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Fall:</b> Sabbatical, no teaching</li>
    <li><b>Winter:</b> Sabbatical, no teaching</li>
    <li><b>Spring:</b> Conversational Interfaces</li>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    
    <ul>
     <li> I received a <a href="http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/humboldt-award.html">Humbold Research Award</a> in 2011.  The laudation is <a href="http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/press_room/Forbus%20lauded%20at%2040th%20Symposium%20for%20Research%20Award%20Winners.pdf">here</a>.</li>
     <li> I am a fellow of the <a href="http://aaai.org">Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence</a>,
      the <a href="http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/index.html">Cognitive Science Society</a>,
         and the <a href="http://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a>.</li>
     <li> Dedre and I were fellows at the <a href="http://www.h-w-k.de/en.html">Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg</a> (HWK).  We had very productive stays there in 2012 and 2013.</li>
     <li>In 1996 I argued that building computer models would become a <a
         href="http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/files/simhobby-local.htm">popular
         hobby</a>. That has happened, as illustrated by the the widespread growth of modding and open-ended hobbyist software. However, there are a number of <a
         href="http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/papers/Files/Towards%20Construction%20Kits%20for%20Virtual%20World%20Artifacts.pdf">technical
         problems</a> that, if overcome, could make things even more interesting.  </li>
     <li>My <a
         href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/%7Eforbus/ancient-forbus.htm">old web
         page</a> provides an ancient capsule summary of my research interests.</li>
     <li ><a
         href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/%7Eforbus/KDF_w_Chinka.jpg">A friend
         from Belize</a></li>
     <li >On <a
         href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/%7Eforbus/K_in_uniform.jpg">DARPA
         duty</a> </li>
    <li> A course I used to teach: <b><a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/370.html">EECS 370-0</a>:
    Computer Game Design<br>
    </b>Fundamentals of computer game design. Topics include: Plot, narrative
    and character, simulation for creating game worlds, AI for synthetic
    characters, tuning gameplay. Substantial programming and project work.<b><br>
    Prerequisites: </b>EECS-311, plus at least one of EECS-322, EECS-343, EECS-348, or
    EECS-351.
    </br>An interesting feature of this course is that,
    instead of a final exam, we throw a party where everyone in the department is invited
    to play the games students have built.  Feedback from partygoers is a factor in grading.
    This combination of a hard ship date and real performance requirement tends
    to make the course a very interesting experience.   To the best of my knowledge, this course, which started in 1998, was the
    first computer game design (not development) course in the US</li>
    <li>One focal area of the Cognitive Systems Area is interactive
    entertaiment.  A course which I taught once, and may teach again,
    pushes on some frontiers in that area:  <a href="395gai/index.html">EECS 392-22: Artificial
    Intelligence for Interactive Entertainment</a>. This was an experimental
    course, which covered both the kinds of AI techniques used in strategy games
    and the application of advanced natural language and reasoning technology to building
    new kinds of conversation-oriented entertainment systems. The poster for
    the course is <a href="395gai/CS395gai%20advertisement%202-7-05.pdf">here</a>.</li>
